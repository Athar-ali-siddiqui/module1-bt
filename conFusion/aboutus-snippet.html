      <h2>Our History</h2>
      <p>
        Started in 2010, Ristorante con Fusion quickly established itself as a
        culinary icon par excellence in Hong Kong. With its unique brand of
        world fusion cuisine that can be found nowhere else, it enjoys patronage
        from the A-list clientele in Hong Kong. Featuring four of the best
        three-star Michelin chefs in the world, you never know what will arrive
        on your plate the next time you visit us.
      </p>
      <p>
        The restaurant traces its humble beginnings to
        <em>The Frying Pan</em>, a successful chain started by our CEO, Mr.
        Peter Pan, that featured for the first time the world's best cuisines in
        a pan.

                Our CEO, Peter, credits his hardworking East Asian immigrant
                parents who undertook the arduous journey to the shores of
                America with the intention of giving their children the best
                future. His mother's wizardy in the kitchen whipping up the
                tastiest dishes with whatever is available inexpensively at the
                supermarket, was his first inspiration to create the fusion
                cuisines for which
                <em>The Frying Pan</em> became well known. He brings his zeal
                for fusion cuisines to this restaurant, pioneering
                cross-cultural culinary connections.

                Our CFO, Danny, as he is affectionately referred to by his
